    <h1 class="head">Applications of Trigonometry</h1><hr>
    <p class="description">Trigonometry has numerous applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, architecture, and even 
        computer graphics. Here are some common applications of trigonometry:</p>
    <h2 class="subhead">1. Navigation and Surveying</h2> 
    <p class="text">Trigonometry is used in navigation to determine the position of ships and aircraft. It helps in calculating distances and
         angles between landmarks, which is essential for accurate navigation. Surveyors use trigonometric principles to measure land and 
         create maps.</p>

    <h2 class="subhead">2. Architecture and Engineering</h2> 
    <p class="text">In architecture, trigonometry is used to calculate structural loads, roof slopes, and angles of elevation. Engineers 
        use trigonometric functions to analyze forces in structures, design mechanical systems, and study wave patterns in electrical 
        engineering.</p>
    <h2 class="subhead">3. Physics</h2> 
    <p class="text">Trigonometry is fundamental in physics for analyzing wave motion, oscillations, and circular motion. It helps in 
        understanding the behavior of light and sound waves, as well as in calculating projectile trajectories.</p>
    <h2 class="subhead">4. Computer Graphics</h2> 
    <p class="text">In computer graphics, trigonometry is used to create realistic animations and 3D models. It helps in calculating 
        angles of rotation, perspective projections, and lighting effects to enhance visual realism.</p>
    <h2 class="subhead">5. Astronomy</h2> 
    <p class="text">Astronomers use trigonometry to calculate distances between celestial bodies, determine their positions in the sky, 
        and analyze their movements. It is essential for understanding the geometry of the universe.</p>
    <h2 class="subhead">6. Music Theory</h2> 
    <p class="text">Trigonometric functions are used in music theory to analyze sound waves and harmonics. They help in understanding 
        musical scales, tuning systems, and the physics of sound production.</p>
    <p class="text">Overall, trigonometry plays a crucial role in various scientific and practical applications, making it an essential
         area of study for students pursuing careers in STEM fields.</p>
