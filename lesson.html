            <p>Welcome to the first lesson of our Trigonometry course! In this lesson, we will cover the basics of trigonometry, including:</p>
            <ul class="lesson-topics">
                <li>Definition of Trigonometry</li>
                <li>History and Importance</li>
                <li>Basic Terminology</li>
                <li>Introduction to Angles</li></br>
            </ul>
            <h2>What is Trigonometry?</h2>
            <p>Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. It is essential for various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.</p>
            </br><h2>History of Trigonometry</h2>
            <p>The origins of trigonometry date back to ancient civilizations, where it was used in astronomy and navigation. The Greeks further developed it, leading to the modern understanding we have today.</p>
            </br><h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
            <p>In trigonometry, we often deal with terms like angle, sine, cosine, tangent, etc. Understanding these terms is crucial for mastering the subject.</p>
            </br><h2>Introduction to Angles</h2>
            <p>An angle is formed by two rays originating from a common point called the vertex. Angles are measured in <b>degrees or radians</b>, and they play a significant role in trigonometric calculations.</p>
            </br><h2>Next Steps</h2>    
            <p>In the next lesson, we will dive deeper into trigonometric ratios and how they relate to right triangles. Make sure to review this lesson and practice the concepts before moving on.</p>
